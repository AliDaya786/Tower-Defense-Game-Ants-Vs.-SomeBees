# Tower-Defense-Game-Ants-Vs.-SomeBees

I created a tower defense game called Ants Vs. SomeBees. 
The ant queen populates her colony with the bravest ants you can muster. 
The ants deplyed by the user must protect their queen from the evil bees that invade their territory. 
Irritate the bees enough by throwing leaves at them, and they will be vanquished. 
Fail to pester the airborne intruders adequately, and your queen will succumb to the bees' wrath. 
This game is inspired by PopCap Games' Plants Vs. Zombies.
